Budgeto is a money management prototype app that allows users to split their income into customizable categories of "need," "expenses," and "savings." With features like autopay for bills, manual and planning tools for emergency funds and car purchases, Budgeto helps users stay on top of their finances and reach their financial goals.

Budgeto is a comprehensive money management app designed to help users take control of their finances. With Budgeto, users can easily split their income into customizable categories, including "need," "expenses," and "savings." The app's default settings allocate 50% to needs, 30% to expenses, and 20% to savings, but users can adjust these percentages as needed to suit their individual financial goals.

The "need" category includes an autopay feature that allows users to set a date and time for bills to be paid automatically, as well as the ability to add payees with their account numbers for easy direct bill payments. The "expenses" category includes a direct pay feature.

The "savings" category offers both manual and automatic investment options. The manual investment section provides users with a selection of demo stocks based on their risk tolerance, allowing them to invest in the stock market with confidence. The automatic investment feature is a static form, where users can set up automatic investments and send it to the organization.

At the start of every month, the remaining amounts from the "need" and "expenses" categories are automatically transferred to the "savings" category, encouraging users to save and reach their financial goals. The app also offers transaction lists for each category and an all-transactions list on the home screen, providing users with an easy way to keep track of their spending.

Budgeto also includes planning tools for emergency funds and car purchases. The emergency fund planning tool calculates the recommended amount to save, which is six times the "expenses" category by default and if the user adds money more than once then its the six times average of the amount added in "expenses" category, this also allows users to adjust the amount and the monthly deduction from the "need" category. The car plan tool allows users to input the cost of the car, enter the split percentage, and set a monthly deduction amount. Both the emergency funds and car plan amounts are deducted on the first of every month automatically, ensuring that users are consistently making progress toward their financial goals.

Budgeto features user email authentication, which adds an extra layer of security to the app, as well as multi-theme mode, which allows users to switch between light and dark mode to suit their personal preferences.
